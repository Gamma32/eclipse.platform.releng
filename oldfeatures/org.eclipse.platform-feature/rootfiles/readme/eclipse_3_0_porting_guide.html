<h1>Eclipse 3.0 Porting Guide</h1>
<p>Draft for 3.0 M1<br>
Last revised June 17, 2003</p>
<p>Eclipse 3.0 is not fully compatible with 2.0 and 2.1. The decision to break
compatibility was taken to give us additional freedom to innovate and make
Eclipse 3.0 significantly better than it could have been had we tried to
maintain compatibility. That said, most of the Eclipse APIs are the same in 3.0
as in 2.1. We have only broken APIs in 3.0 when there is a compelling case for
doing so, and have tried to do it in a controlled way that minimizes the effort
required to port an existing plug-in to the 3.0 APIs. This porting guide covers
all areas of breaking API changes, and describes how to port existing 2.1
plug-ins to 3.0.</p>
<p><i>Note: This is a work in progress. An up-to-date draft of the Eclipse 3.0
Porting Guide is being included with each milestone build to facilitate climbing
aboard the 3.0 release wagon at an early stage, or to estimate the amount of
effort that will be involved in eventually porting existing plug-ins to 3.0. The
Eclipse APIs will be in their finished form by milestone M5 (see <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_0.html">Eclipse
3.0 plan</a> for exact dates).</i></p>
<h2>General Information on Compatibility</h2>
<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 is upwards
contract-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 and 2.1 except in those areas noted
below. This means that programs in full compliance with contracts specified in
Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 APIs will need to be ported to Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs. (API
is construed broadly to include such things as plug-in extension points.)
Downward contract compatibility is not supported. There is no guarantee that
compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs would ensure compliance with Eclipse SDK
2.0 or 2.1 APIs. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain contract compatibility.
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 is not upwards
binary-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 and 2.1. Plug-ins built for Eclipse SDK
2.0 or 2.1 will need to be ported and recompiled for Eclipse SDK 3.0. Downward
plug-in compatibility is not supported either. Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 3.0 will
not be usable in Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain binary compatibility.
<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 is upwards source-compatible
with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 except in the areas noted below. This means that
source files written to use Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 APIs might successfully
compile and run against Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs, although this is not guaranteed.
Downward source compatibility is not supported. If source files use new Eclipse
SDK APIs, they will not be usable with an earlier version of the Eclipse SDK.
<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.0 is upwards
workspace-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 unless noted. This means that
workspaces and projects created with Eclipse SDK 2.0 or 2.1 can be successfully
opened by Eclipse SDK 3.0 and upgraded to a 3.0 workspace. This includes both
hidden metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as well as
metadata files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which
may propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories.
Individual plug-ins developed for Eclipse SDK 3.0 should provide similar upwards
compatibility for their hidden and visible workspace metadata created by earlier
versions; 3.0 plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their
plug-ins recognize 3.0, 2.1, and 2.0 metadata and process it appropriately. User
interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded. Downward
workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created (or opened) by
Eclipse SDK 3.0 will be unusable with an earlier version of Eclipse SDK.&nbsp;Visible
metadata files created (or overwritten) by Eclipse SDK 3.0 will generally be
unusable with earlier versions of Eclipse SDK.
<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and
certainly everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are
considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
release much less with an earlier releases. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant
plug-ins. This porting guide does not cover non-API methods and classes.</p>
